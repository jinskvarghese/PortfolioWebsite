                <h3>Crossroads&apos;23 Promo</h3>
                <h4>The Brief</h4>
                <p>Crossroads&apos;23 was the latest iteration of the beloved techno-cultural fest of Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology. Having crossed expectations the previous time, we were covered with much more of an expectation to keep and increase the hype for the event.</p>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>Our aim was to create a promotional video that captured the essence of returning to one's roots while maintaining a cultural-futuristic atmosphere. The focus was on visual storytelling, utilizing aesthetic shots to convey the concept of home and its significance. This case study explores the creative approach, planning, and execution of the project.</p>
                <h4>Concept and Theme:</h4>
                <p>The theme for this iteration was "Returning to the Real World," a shift from the previous dream-based concept. The team decided to bring the brand closer to its cultural roots while infusing a futuristic vibe. The core idea was to explore the concept of "home" and what it meant to different individuals. The project aimed to showcase the diverse elements that contributed to the sense of home, such as street views, people, transportation, and nature.</p>
                <h4>Creative Direction:</h4>
                <p>The creative direction was clear from the beginning, emphasizing the importance of visual storytelling. The goal was to evoke emotions and create a connection with the audience by offering pleasing and aesthetic shots. The promo was carefully designed to be cinematic, with a focus on subliminal messages that gradually built excitement. The team deliberately avoided aggressive marketing tactics, instead opting for a calm and introspective approach.</p>

This narrative journey began with an engaging introduction, carefully designed to immediately capture the viewer's attention and set the tone for the rest of the movie. From there, we gradually built up the excitement, using a combination of music, visuals, and pacing to ensure a captivating viewing experience.</p>

                <h4>Outcome and Reception:</h4>
                <p>Finally, in the aftermath of the event, we took the time to gather feedback specifically on the aftermovie. This was not just a formality but a crucial step in our process. By understanding what aspects resonated well with the audience, as well as identifying the areas that did not quite hit the mark, we were able to gain a comprehensive view of the overall reception. This feedback proved to be invaluable as it provided us with core insights and key learnings that we could leverage for the creation of aftermovies for our future events. It allowed us to continuously improve and refine our approach, ensuring that each aftermovie is better than the last.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

Every action and angle had to be carefully executed, preserving the consistency for a flawless transition from the practice session to the grand finale.</p>
                <h4>Editing</h4>
                <p>While editing, I utilized the first clip, the practice session, as a reference for continuity. In the second video, corresponding movements were scaled correctly, and I strategically cut the footage at the point where the dancer snaps their fingers. To maintain a seamless motion, I incorporated motion blur for a few frames. The audio during the initial segment was from the practice session recording, seamlessly transitioning to the original, pristine audio after the snap. To enhance the impact, I showcased the dancers' best moves post-transition and concluded the video in a concise 15 seconds, aiming for a short and sweet presentation without any lag.</p>
                <h4>Outcome and Reception</h4>
                <p>The outcome exceeded expectations, with a tremendously positive response and widespread acclaim. The video's success was evident as it garnered over 13.4k views on Instagram. Many viewers were captivated by the seamless transition and expressed awe, prompting questions about whether it was pre-planned. The positive feedback and engagement reinforced the impact of the carefully crafted video, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>In conclusion, this video exceeded expectations, amassing over 13.4k views on Instagram. The seamless transition and meticulous editing sparked awe and curiosity, leaving a lasting impression. This project stands as a testament to thoughtful execution, making our final-year Christmas celebration unforgettable.</p>

                <h3>Crossroads&apos;22 Aftermovie</h3>
                <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                <p>The After movie must be a visual representation of the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of Crossroads 2022, which took place from 26-28 June. It should capture the energy, excitement, and diversity of the event, highlighting the various activities, performances, and experiences that made Crossroads MBCET a memorable experience for participants and attendees.</p>
                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>The task at hand is to encapsulate the diverse and vibrant spirit of Crossroads MBCET, translating its essence into a visually captivating experience for viewers. This involves delving deep into the core of what makes Crossroads MBCET unique, understanding its values and ethos, and then reflecting these in a visually compelling way. We aim to create an experience that not only captures attention but also resonates with viewers on an emotional level, creating a lasting impression of what Crossroads MBCET truly stands for.</p>
                <h4>Visual Style</h4>
                <p>The aftermovie that we are crafting will be a feast for the eyes, featuring a multitude of vibrant colors that capture the spirit of the event. Our editing style will rely heavily on fast cuts, which will not only keep the pace lively and engaging but also allow us to showcase a variety of scenes and moments. In addition to this, we will employ smooth transitions to fluidly connect these different segments, resulting in a seamless viewing experience. Our primary goal is to create a visually captivating and energetically charged representation of the event. To ensure that the viewer's immersion is never broken, we will be diligent in avoiding any form of lag throughout the entire video.</p>
                <h4>Storytelling</h4>
                <p>The aftermovie achieved a remarkable feat by crafting a compelling narrative that fully engaged its viewers and artfully highlighted the most unforgettable aspects of Crossroads MBCET. By combining visual storytelling techniques with a keen understanding of the event's unique spirit, it managed to provide a visually captivating experience that encapsulated the essence of the event. This was not merely a recap of the proceedings, but rather a carefully constructed narrative that allowed viewers, both those who attended and those who didn't, to truly grasp the energy, excitement, and emotion that pervaded Crossroads MBCET.</p>
                <h4>Music Selection</h4>
                <p>For the aftermovie, we needed a very energetic music to complement the fast cuts and bring in a nostalgic feeling of the event. Therefore two tracks (Aadiyillallo, and Radioactive), with similar beats were selected since they had a strong beat and upbeat tempo to create a lively and energetic atmosphere. Additionally, they blended well, and the first one incorporated elements of nostaligia (being a the most exciting performance of the previous iterations band performance), and the event's theme/culture and consequently helped enhance the overall experience of the aftermovie.</p>
                <h4>Outcome and Reception</h4>
                <p>The After movie, capturing the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of Crossroads MBCET 2022, surpassed all expectations with its remarkable outcome and reach. As it premiered to an enthusiastic audience, the film resonated deeply with viewers, transporting them back to the exhilarating three-day event. Its vivid portrayal of the energy, excitement, and diversity of Crossroads MBCET left a lasting impact, stirring emotions and igniting a sense of nostalgia among participants and attendees. </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Beyond the festival grounds, the After movie garnered widespread acclaim and appreciation, drawing a broad audience from various corners of the world. Through the power of captivating storytelling and stunning visuals, the film amplified the festival's essence, making Crossroads MBCET a cherished and unforgettable experience for those who witnessed it and inspiring countless others to eagerly await the next edition.</p>
